Why do organizations become similar to each other? Classical organizational studies show that related organizations may become alike to each other to be successful in evolution within a whole organizational field, which is categorized as organizational isomorphism. What are the drivers and mechanisms of isomorphism in a specific group of organizations? By looking into a specific set of online communities scoped on feminism and professions, this study intends to develop organizational isomorphism theory by applying it in the settings of online informal organizations and combining it with feminist views, to shed light on the question of why feminism communities become similar to each other (or not). 

## Research Questions

1. Does the sentiment similarity of each dyad of communities increase or decrease from 2019 to 2023 monthly?

2. Can the sentiment similarity change of each dyad of communities be predicted by (1) active user overlap, (2) community rule, and (3) community discussion density?

## Data

This study retrieves textual data from nine parallel “Women in XXX” Douban communities (around 5000 posts for each group), serving as informal online communities for females communicating to achieve their professional goals. After conducting sentiment analysis on each group each month, we group the 9 communities into 36 dyads and calculate their sentiment similarity monthly. Then we explore which factors would influence the patterns of similarity change, evaluating the predictive power of active user overlap (cooccurring commenter percentage), group rule (cooccurring criteria in community rules), and community discussion density (number of posts).



## Methods

1. Clustering & Topic Modeling to Discover Higher-Order Patterns of Meaning
2. Word Embeddings to Explore Meaning Spaces
3. Deep Learning to Perform Causal Inference
